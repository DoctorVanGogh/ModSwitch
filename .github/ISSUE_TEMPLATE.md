If your issue is a bug report please attach a _zipped_ version of your 
`C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config\Mod_1139051045_ModSwitch.xml` (if using the steam version) or `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config\Mod_ModSwitch_ModSwitch.xml` (if using a local version).

Please also attach a copy of your `Player.log`. You can find this by opening the ingame options via the 'Open Log Folder' button in the middle column.
If the game totally barfs and restarts with everything disabled (trust mne, you'll know), please also attach `Player-prev.log`.
When in doubt, just submit both ;)
